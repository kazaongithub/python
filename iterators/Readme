Iterators
----------

Iterator is an object which allows a programmer to traverse all the elements of a collection,
regardless of its specific implementation.

In Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol.

Iterators have several advantages:
- Cleaner code
- Iterators can work with infinite sequences
- Iterators save resources
