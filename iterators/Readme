Iterators
----------

Iterator is an object which allows a programmer to traverse all the elements of a collection,
regardless of its specific implementation.

In Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol.

Iterators have several advantages:
- Cleaner code
- Iterators can work with infinite sequences
- Iterators save resources

Python iterator objects are required to support two methods while following the iterator protocol.

__iter__ returns the iterator object itself. This is used in 'for' and 'in' statements.
__next__ method returns the next value from the iterator.
    if there is no more items to return then it should raise StopIteration exception.
